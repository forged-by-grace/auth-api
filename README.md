**FastAPI Authentication and Authorization API with Redis and MongoDB**

This repository hosts a high-performance API built with FastAPI, designed to manage user authentication and authorization securely. Leveraging Redis for session management and MongoDB for flexible data storage, this API offers robust features including:

- **User Management**: Register new users, update profiles, and manage account details efficiently.
  
- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT tokens, with Redis used for storing and managing session tokens.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement fine-grained access control based on user roles to restrict access to specific endpoints and functionalities.
  
- **Password Hashing**: Safely store user passwords using strong cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for enhanced security.

- **Audit Logging**: Track and log authentication and authorization events for compliance and monitoring purposes.

- **Integration Friendly**: Easily integrate with frontend frameworks (React, Angular, etc.) and backend systems (Node.js, Flask, Django, etc.) due to FastAPI's compatibility and flexibility.

### Technologies Used:
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for session management and caching.
- **MongoDB**: A scalable NoSQL database for storing user profiles, access control data, and audit logs.

This API is designed to be scalable, secure, and easily extensible, making it ideal for developers aiming to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in their applications.
